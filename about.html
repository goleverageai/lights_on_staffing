                        <p>Lights on Staffing, led by Steven Glynn, is an AEC recruiting firm that combines the best aspects of internal and external recruitment models. With over 20 years of experience in the recruitment industry and a background as an Environmental Engineer, I bring a unique perspective to the table. My career began in engineering, but in 2004, I transitioned to recruitment, where I worked for one of the largest U.S. recruiting firms for 15 years, managing a team of recruiters. Over the years, I've learned that the most successful partnerships occur when I function as an internal recruiter, truly getting to know my clients. That's the foundation of my approach at Lights on Staffing‚Äîblending the strengths of both recruitment models to create a highly effective, retained search service.</p>
